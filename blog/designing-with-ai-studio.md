# The Future of Design Workflow

Artificial Intelligence is not just a buzzword; it's a fundamental shift in how we approach creative problem-solving.

## Why Adapt?

1. **Speed**: Iteration cycles are reduced from days to minutes.
2. **Inspiration**: AI acts as a collaborative partner, suggesting directions you might not have considered.
3. **Execution**: Automating repetitive tasks allows designers to focus on strategy.

### The Human Touch
Despite the automation, the *human eye* remains curatorial. We choose what feels right.

## Conclusion
Embrace the tools, but master the principles.
