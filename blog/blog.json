  Artificial Intelligence is not just a buzzword; it's a fundamental shift in how we approach creative problem-solving.
  
  ## Why Adapt?
  
  1. **Speed**: Iteration cycles are reduced from days to minutes.
  2. **Inspiration**: AI acts as a collaborative partner, suggesting directions you might not have considered.
  3. **Execution**: Automating repetitive tasks allows designers to focus on strategy.
  
  ### The Human Touch
  Despite the automation, the *human eye* remains curatorial. We choose what feels right.

  The pendulum swings back. After years of clean, geometric sans-serifs domination, we are seeing a resurgence of **personality**.
  
  ## Key Trends
  
  *   **Kinetic Type**: Text that moves, breathes, and reacts to user input.
  *   **Neo-Brutalism**: Raw, unpolished, and structural fonts.
  *   **Serif Comeback**: Elegant, high-contrast serifs are returning to UI design.
