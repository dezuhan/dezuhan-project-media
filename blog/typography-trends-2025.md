# Typography in 2025

The pendulum swings back. After years of clean, geometric sans-serifs domination, we are seeing a resurgence of **personality**.

## Key Trends

*   **Kinetic Type**: Text that moves, breathes, and reacts to user input.
*   **Neo-Brutalism**: Raw, unpolished, and structural fonts.
*   **Serif Comeback**: Elegant, high-contrast serifs are returning to UI design.
